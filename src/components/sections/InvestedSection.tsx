              Paramount Intelligence's primary model involves a variable success
              fee tied directly to the efficiency milestones you've set (cost
              savings, throughput increase, error reduction). Fee ranges depend
              on the scale and complexity of your operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a pure success fee is not feasible, we work with you to
              establish other value-based incentives. Our goal is full
              alignment, ensuring we're maximally incentivized to generate
              operational alpha for your business.
